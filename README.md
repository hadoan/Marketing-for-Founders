## 📷 Social Media Marketing
Managing multiple accounts across all social media platforms can be pretty intense (there’s a reason why it’s a full-time job); however, there are a couple of strategies worth trying: building in public and social listening.

**Building in Public** - it’s the easiest social media marketing tactic. In a nutshell, it’s about using your personal profile to share expertise, product updates, and behind-the-scenes content:
- [How to Build in Public as a Founder](https://www.failory.com/blog/building-in-public)

- [How to market to developers on Twitter](https://www.markepear.dev/blog/developer-marketing-twitter)

**Social listening** - tracking and joining online conversations on topics related to your Startup is pretty helpful to get in touch with users and learn more about them:

<br/><br/><br/>

## ❄ Sales & Cold Outreach
Most people hate cold outreach and everything connected with direct sales. Yes, depending on your approach, it might be hard to scale and time-intensive, but cold emails and DMs are the most straightforward way to get in touch with potential users, collect precious early-stage feedback and find the first customers for your startup.

So, how can you find people on target? What should you write in your messages? And how can you scale cold outreach?

## 📈 SEO
Should you focus on SEO in the early days of your startup? Probably not, SEO takes time (and backlinks), but this doesn’t mean you should neglect it either.

SEO is the foundation for many startups, and it can get you a steady source of traffic without having to spend anything other than the time to do it.

These guides and tips will help you get started:

## 💌 Email Marketing
Email marketing can help you with almost anything: onboarding new users, boosting free-to-paid conversions, promoting affiliate/referral programs, and collecting feedback. Plus, it’s often your only option to engage users outside of your product.

<br/><br/><br/>

## 🧲 Content Marketing
Just like SEO, content marketing is one of the first growth levers to pull for a startup. This time, instead of creating content to praise search engines, you’ll be sharing it where your audience hangs out and hijacking trends for free exposure:
- [Getting PR for your SaaS](https://1millionarr.substack.com/p/getting-pr-for-your-saas)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 💸 Ads
Every startup will think about adding a paid channel to their marketing strategy sooner or later and Ads are one of the best ways to accelerate user acquisition.

Here are a few guides to help you avoid burning through your budget before getting any return from your Ad campaign:
- [How to get started with Google Ads for early-stage B2B SaaS startups](https://www.mrrunlocked.com/p/google-ads-guide)
- [The No-Fluff LinkedIn Ads Playbook](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/p/the-no-fluff-linkedin-ads-playbook)

- [Burning money on paid ads for a dev tool – what we've learned](https://posthog.com/founders/dev-marketing-paid-ads)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 👩‍🏫 Influencer Marketing
Going where the audience is is the first rule of marketing. That’s why partnering with content creators and influencers can help you grow your startup and connect directly with customers.

However, online advice on influencer marketing is often bad and outdated, so let’s take a look at a few firsthand experiences:
- [Should Influencers be part of your GTM Strategy?](https://knowledge.gtmstrategist.com/p/should-influencers-be-part-of-your)
- [Short Form Playbook from Jenny AI](https://www.starterstory.com/10m-playbook?utm_source=youtube&utm_campaign=10msaasplaybook) (also watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcCnqLBhvXY))
- [How Clerk Partners with YouTube’s Dev Community](https://playbooks.hypergrowthpartners.com/p/how-clerk-partners-with-youtubes)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 💑 Affiliates and Referrals
Word-of-mouth is often the main growth driver for bootstrapped startups. Why? Because affiliate and referral programs are easy to set up, cheap (you only pay if the user converts), and build trust and credibility (when users recommend your product, you’re not only getting traffic, but also social proof that it works).

- [10 steps for a great Referral Program](https://thegrowthmind.substack.com/p/10-steps-for-a-great-referral-program)
- [Your guide to B2B referrals](https://www.growthunhinged.com/p/your-guide-to-b2b-referrals)

- [8 Affiliate & Referral Email Examples](https://pin.it/5BxRb4Zv4)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 🛠 Free-Tool Marketing
Free mini tools are your best bet on going viral, generating PR coverage and backlinks, and driving a ton of organic traffic. Plus, it doesn’t feel like marketing (that’s the reason why it’s also called Engineering as Marketing).

- [Mini tools are 10x more powerful than free trials](https://www.marketingideas.com/p/mini-tools-are-10x-more-powerful)

- [Building Free Tools for Marketing (SEO)](https://dmytrokrasun.com/posts/building-free-tools-for-marketing-seo/)

<br/><br/><br/>

## 🎯 Landing Pages, Messaging and Positioning
Most startup websites are ineffective. They fail to tell who the product is for, what the product does, and why it is better. This means confused visitors, poor conversion rates, and wasted marketing $$$.

Here are a few resources to turn your website into a sales and marketing asset:

## 🎰 Pricing
_“Your product delivers the value added to target customers; with pricing, we capture added value back to build a sustainable business.”_

Confused? You’re not alone. Pricing and business model are the toughest things to crack for a startup.

Here are a few frameworks to get your price right:

<br/><br/><br/>

## 💡 Idea Validation
One of the most common and painful mistakes you can make is having an idea and immediately spending all your time building a product without validating demand first.

Some ideas are great, but most aren’t worth your time. So, how can you validate a startup idea?
